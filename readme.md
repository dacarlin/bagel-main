# For students

This is the main repository for the Siegel group's Bagel project. Since you're just getting started, take a minute to read through this document to get a sense of what you'll be working on in the next few weeks.

## Timeline 

Briefly, over the course of several weeks, you will design a handful of mutant enzymes, test your designs in the lab, and then take what you've learned to design a new set of mutants. 

### First week

Get started with Foldit. First, get the [Foldit model](http://github.com/dacarlin/bagel-foldit) and our group's internal copy of Foldit. 

### Second week 

Participate in boot camp! Get started in the wet lab by following the [protocols for protein production, purification, and kinetic assay](http://github.com/dacarlin/bagel-protocol)

### Third week

Analyze your data using the [Bagel data analysis tools](http://github.com/dacarlin/bagel-tools) and write up your results. Finally, design a few round of mutants! 

# For instructors 

This is the main repository for the Siegel group's Bagel project. The lab protocols and data analysis tools provided, along with the [parts list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/106pUlbfcXcYa9Vg8fXZFAt3Imil9BYLZ1ztZ-R9lcZw/edit?usp=sharing), enable any lab to get started with enzyme engineering.

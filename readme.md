## For students

This is the main repository for an ongoing project in the Siegel group codenamed "Bagel". If you're just getting started, take a minute to read through this document to get a sense of what you'll be working on in the next few weeks.

## Timeline 

In the first week, you will computationally design three mutant enzymes. In the next two weeks, you'll test your designs in the lab, and see how the computational predictions you made in the first week play out in data. 

+ **First week: get started with Foldit**. First, get the [Foldit model](http://github.com/dacarlin/bagel-foldit) and [our group's internal copy of Foldit](http://games.cs.washington.edu/foldit/build/release/). Check out the [cheat sheet](http://github.com/dacarlin/bagel-foldit) to learn how to load in your puzzle and get started designing mutants. 

+ **Second week: wet lab "boot camp"**. Get started in the wet lab by following the [protocols for protein production, purification, and kinetic assay](http://github.com/dacarlin/bagel-protocol) to produce, purify, and assay the BglB wild type protein, GFP, and two mutants designed by previous students. 

+ **Third week: analyze your data and learn from the mutations you designed**. Analyze your data using the [data analysis tools](http://github.com/dacarlin/bagel-fitter) and write up your results. Learn how the mutations you made changed the kinetic properties of the enzyme. Finally, design a few round of mutants! 

# For teachers  

This is the main repository for the Siegel group's Bagel project. The lab protocols and data analysis tools provided, along with the [parts list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/106pUlbfcXcYa9Vg8fXZFAt3Imil9BYLZ1ztZ-R9lcZw/edit?usp=sharing), enable any lab to get started with enzyme engineering. 

# Python modules in use by the Siegel group's "Bagel" project  

Current Python modules for designing mutagenic oligos, generating Transcripic input, and automatic analyis of sequencing results are available in the repository [bagel-orders](https://github.com/dacarlin/bagel-orders).

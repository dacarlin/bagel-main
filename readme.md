This is the main repository for an ongoing project in the Siegel group codenamed "Bagel". The researchers in the Bagel Team are investigating how point mutations to enzymes change functional parameters, stabilty, and structure. 

## Welcome to the Bagel Team! 

### Background reading 

+ [BglB crystal structure](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283607007413)

+ [Our group's first paper on Bagel project](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0147596)

### Get started with Foldit

First, get a [our group's internal copy of Foldit](http://fold.it/dist/internal/build/). Then, download the [BglB Rosetta model](http://github.com/dacarlin/bagel-foldit). Instructions for using Foldit can be found in the sme place. 

### Wet lab "boot camp"

Get started in the wet lab by following the [protocols for protein production, purification, and kinetic assay](http://github.com/dacarlin/bagel-protocol) to produce, purify, and assay the BglB wild type protein, GFP, and two mutants. 

### Produce, purify, and assay your mutants in the wet lab

Following the procedures you learned in "boot camp", kinetically characterize the mutants that you designed. 

### Analyze your data and learn from the mutations you designed

Analyze your data using the [data analysis tools](http://github.com/dacarlin/bagel-fitter) ([internal UC Davis link](http://bagel.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu) and write up your results. Learn how the mutations you made changed the kinetic properties of BglB.

# For students

This is the main repository for the Siegel group's Bagel project. Since you're just getting started, take a minute to read through this document to get a sense of what you'll be working on in the next few weeks.

## Timeline 

Over the course of several weeks, you will design a handful of mutant enzymes, test your designs in the lab, and then take what you've learned to design a new set of mutants. 

+ **First week: get started with Foldit**. First, get the [Foldit model](http://github.com/dacarlin/bagel-foldit) and [our group's internal copy of Foldit](http://games.cs.washington.edu/foldit/build/release/). Check out the [cheat sheet](http://github.com/dacarlin/bagel-foldit) to learn how to load in your puzzle and get started designing mutants. 

+ **Second week: wet lab "boot camp"**. Get started in the wet lab by following the [protocols for protein production, purification, and kinetic assay](http://github.com/dacarlin/bagel-protocol) to produce, purify, and assay the BglB wild type protein, GFP, and two mutants designed by previous students. 

+ **Third week: analyze your data and learn from the mutations you designed**. Analyze your data using the [data analysis tools](http://github.com/dacarlin/bagel-fitter) and write up your results. Learn how the mutations you made changed the kinetic properties of the enzyme. Finally, design a few round of mutants! 

# For instructors 

This is the main repository for the Siegel group's Bagel project. The lab protocols and data analysis tools provided, along with the [parts list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/106pUlbfcXcYa9Vg8fXZFAt3Imil9BYLZ1ztZ-R9lcZw/edit?usp=sharing), enable any lab to get started with enzyme engineering.

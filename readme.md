This is the main repository for an ongoing project in the Siegel group codenamed "Bagel". The researchers in the Bagel Team are investigating how point mutations to enzymes change functional parameters, stabilty, and structure. 

## Welcome to the Bagel Team 

### Background 

+ [Crystal structure paper (paywall)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283607007413)

+ [Our group's paper on the project as a whole](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0147596)

### Timeline 

In the first week, you will computationally design three mutant enzymes. Next, you'll test your designs in the lab, and see how the computational predictions you made in the first week compare to your results. 

+ **First week: get started with Foldit**. First, get the [Foldit model](http://github.com/dacarlin/bagel-foldit) and [our group's internal copy of Foldit](http://fold.it/dist/internal/build/). Check out the [cheat sheet](http://github.com/dacarlin/bagel-foldit) to learn how to load in your puzzle. 

+ **Second week: wet lab "boot camp"**. Get started in the wet lab by following the [protocols for protein production, purification, and kinetic assay](http://github.com/dacarlin/bagel-protocol) to produce, purify, and assay the BglB wild type protein, GFP, and two mutants designed by previous students. 

+ **Third week: produce, purify, and assay your mutants in the wet lab**. Following the procedures you learned in "boot camp", kinetically characterize the mutants that you designed. 

+ **Forth week: analyze your data and learn from the mutations you designed**. Analyze your data using the [data analysis tools](http://github.com/dacarlin/bagel-fitter) and write up your results. Learn how the mutations you made changed the kinetic properties of the enzyme.
